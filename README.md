a small collection of my VCV Rack modules in a single plugin. [click here](https://github.com/alefnull/alefsbits/releases) for the latest pre-release build.

- **NEW** - added option to `slips` module to remap output values to specified ranges just prior to quantization instead of the default "on generate" remapping behavior. 

## poly shuffle

takes a polyphonic input and on a trigger, will re-order the input's channels by either shuffling them randomly, or rotating them up or down. reset trigger will set the output's channel order back to the input's original order.

## poly counter

given a chosen set of 'start', 'end', and 'inc' (increment) values, each subsequent trigger received will increase the count from 'start' to 'end' by the 'inc' value. poly trigger input will result in a poly output with different counters for each channel, but using the same 'start/end/inc' values. a mono reset trigger will reset all channel counters, but poly reset input will only reset the matching channel's counter.

## lucc

a simple clock divider based on the Lucas sequence of numbers.

## nos

a noise-based experimental "oscillator" that generates waveforms from different random noise sources (random, simplex, and worley).

## turnt

generates triggers based on an input signal crossing certain thresholds. in "direction" mode, triggers will generate whenever the input signal changes direction (i.e. goes from an upward slope to a downward slope or vice versa). in "through zero" mode, triggers will generate whenever the input signal crosses the "zero" line (adjust from -10V to +10V with knob/cv input). in "both" mode, triggers will generate under either/both conditions. there is also a "probability" knob/cv input to control the probability that a trigger will be generated under any given condition. there is also a scope on the module, with individual tabs for up to 16 poly channels, to view the corresponding input signals and the triggers being generated by them.

## slips

a 64 step sequencer, with randomly generated patterns ('generate' button or trigger input). there is an internal quantizer, and knobs to choose the root note and scale that the sequence should be quantized to. (the root note cv can be turned into a v/oct input from the menu). you can specify the number of steps with the 'steps' knob, and the amount (percentage of steps in the generated sequence) of 'slips' to add to the sequence during each cycle. a 'slip' is essentially a random offset applied to a given step in the sequence. at the beginning of each cycle of the sequence, a new set of random steps will be chosen to add new 'slips' to for that cycle. you can also control the probability that a step will be passed to the output (both its cv value and corresponding gate output). finally, there is now also a second "modulation" sequence that is generated with each new main sequence generation (or can be triggered manually with the 'mod gen' button/trigger). the main sequence, slips, and mod sequence can all have independent voltage ranges, which are all set within the right click menu.

## lights

a simple set of 8 inputs with corresponding lights. if latch mode is enabled, a gate/trigger will toggle the corresponding light on/off. if latch mode is disabled, the light will remain on while the input is high (>5V).

## poly play

polyphonic sample player. load sample through right click menu, then choose a number of channels to use. trigger input or button will play the sample, cycling through the available channels with each subsequent trigger.

## probably not

mutes a mono or poly input signal on trigger, based on probability

## logic

perform logical operations on two inputs

## math

applies various math operations on two inputs, clamped to +/-10V

## mlt

two 1:5 polyphonic multiples

## shift

analog shift register with cv-controllable probability per step

## oct sclr

scales voltage to specified octave range

## steps

a simple 8-step sequencer with a randomize trigger input and end-of-cycle trigger output. select output range in right-click menu.

## fibb

a simple clock divider based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers.

## noize

a simple random noise generator with a duration parameter and optional 0-10V cv input.

## poly rand

a simple module that takes a trigger input and a polyphonic input, and picks a random channel to output with each trigger.

## simplex & hold

a simple sample & hold module using an internal simplex noise source. use a polyphonic trigger input to output multiple samples at once.

## blank 6hp

a simple 6hp blank panel.
